                Women who believe that their breasts are small due to a genetic
                cause, or who have undergone small breast size after pregnancy,
                or who have been cured of breast cancer, can perform a breast
                enlargement process, which is done either by placing a filling
                of silicon inside the breast tissue or by injecting breast fat.
                Breast augmentation, which is one of the most popular surgeries
                performed in Turkey with the latest technologies, aims to give
                women the appearance of the breast they want. FDA Center studies
                have demonstrated that silicone breast augmentation does not
                open the way to cancer or any other diseases. Also, there is no
                longer a need for mammography because it is possible to search
                for a lesion in women who use a breast gland by means of MR or
                ultrasound. Breast augmentation surgery is performed by
                injecting the fat taken from another part of the body into the
                form of stem cells and injecting it into the breast tissue or
                transplanting it. This process is also called breast implants.
                Since the injection method is not applicable to everyone, the
                method of cultivation is generally preferred. Breast structure
                is different and unique in every woman. For this reason, the
                size and structure of the filling that should be grown in women
                who are considering breast augmentation surgery should be
                determined according to the woman's expectations and body
                structure with the examination with the doctor.

                <span>When should breast augmentation be done?</span>

                <p>
                  Breasts, which are a symbol of femininity for women, can be
                  disproportionate and small for the body. Sometimes, there may
                  be losses in breast size due to age, pregnancy, breastfeeding,
                  and breast cancer. In such cases, breast augmentation surgery
                  can be performed. If you want a more harmonious and beautiful
                  body, if you think that you will gain self-confidence as a
                  result of this process, if the shape and size of your breasts
                  change due to pregnancy, weight loss or aging, if the breast
                  tissue is removed due to Breast cancer, if the breast is small
                  from birth, if the previously implanted breast pad becomes
                  old, if one of the breasts is smaller than the other and you
                  want to correct their similarity, you can do breast
                  augmentation surgery for a more aesthetic and confident
                  appearance. Before surgery, you should discuss your choices of
                  size and appearance with your doctor. In light of this
                  information, your doctor will choose the most appropriate
                  filler of various types. The types of breast pads differ in
                  their content, shape and structure. The silicone breast
                  filling is divided into two types (anatomical filling and a
                  circular filling) and the anatomical filling is considered the
                  closest to the natural shape of the breast. The breast filling
                  is divided into two types. In terms of content, there is a
                  type that contains saline and a type that contains silicone.
                  As for the surface, there is a smooth type and a composite
                  type. Your doctor will listen to your expectations, and based
                  on the ratio of height, weight, rib width and shoulder, the
                  surgery will start after you choose the filling that best
                  suits you. If your breasts are flabby, your doctor may also
                  recommend a breast lift. In addition, your doctor will ask you
                  to do some tests before surgery to determine if there is any
                  obstacle to the operation. There are some points that must be
                  taken into consideration before surgery: Inform the doctor
                  about the medicines that you use, you should refrain from food
                  and drink 5-6 hours before the operation, a week before the
                  operation should stop taking headache medications, herbal
                  tonics, vitamins and aspirin. Women over the age of forty must
                  work Mammography or ultrasound examination. If you are a
                  smoker or someone who consumes alcoholic beverages, you should
                  stop a week before the operation until the recovery speed
                  increases, although the breast augmentation process is a
                  simple process, but by following the advice of a doctor, I can
                  skip both stages during and after P Easily Maly.

                <span>Breast augmentation by fat injection</span>
                <p>
                  Fat injections, also known as non-surgical breast
                  augmentation, provide the right breast size for women with a
                  small breast problem. Fat is taken from any area of ​​the body
                  where there is more fat and injected into the breast. Thus,
                  the woman gets rid of the extra fat and gets the look she
                  wants. It is a healthier and more natural method than other
                  breast augmentation techniques. The patient may go out on the
                  same day after the fat injection and the anesthesia will be
                  local or general. There is no pain in the breast after the
                  operation because it is done using the needle without an
                  incision, but swelling and bruising may appear in the areas
                  from which the fat is taken. 40% or 50% of the transferred
                  oils will last a lifetime. If necessary, the same procedure
                  can be repeated after 6 months. There is no loss of sensation
                  in the nipple after the operation and there is no obstacle to
                  breastfeeding. After breast augmentation by fat injection, it
                  is possible to return to working life within a day or two.
                  Breast sagging or deformity cannot be treated with fat
                  injection. Moreover, breasts cannot be given a very large
                  volume this way. Therefore, fat transfer may not be suitable
                  for everyone. For breast augmentation with fat injection;
